## 🌅 Morning Routine (Exploration & Planning)

### Start Your Day Fast

**Goal**: Quickly understand what you need to work on

```bash
# Morning: Use Haiku for fast exploration
ccc-haiku
```

**Typical tasks**:
```
❯ Summarize the changes in the last 5 commits
❯ What files were modified yesterday?
❯ Show me the open GitHub issues for this project
❯ List all TODOs in the codebase
❯ Help me understand this module [paste code]
```

**Why Haiku?**
- ⚡ Fastest responses (1-2s)
- ✅ Good enough for exploration
- 💰 Free (Copilot Pro+ subscription)

**Time saved**: 15-30 minutes vs manual review

## 🏗️ Mid-Morning (Feature Implementation)

### Switch to Sonnet for Balanced Work

**Goal**: Implement features efficiently with good quality

```bash
# Implementation: Use Sonnet (balanced)
ccc-sonnet
# or just: ccc
```

**Typical tasks**:
```
❯ Implement user authentication with JWT
❯ Add validation to this form
❯ Fix bug: [describe bug with error message]
❯ Refactor this function for better readability
❯ Add tests for this component
❯ Generate API documentation from this code
```

**Why Sonnet?**
- ⚖️ Best balance quality/speed
- ✅ Reliable for production code
- 💰 Free (unlimited with Copilot)
- 🔧 100% MCP compatible

**Pro tip**: Keep this session open all morning

---

## 🍕 Lunch Break (Let It Think)

### Long-Running Tasks

If you have complex analysis tasks, start them before lunch:

```bash
# Start long task
ccc-opus
❯ Analyze this entire codebase for security vulnerabilities
❯ Propose a refactoring plan for the auth module
```

**Why Opus?**
- 🧠 Best reasoning for complex tasks
- ⏰ Takes longer, but lunch break absorbs wait time
- 💰 Still free with Copilot

---

## ☀️ Afternoon (Focused Implementation)

### Power Through Feature Work

```bash
# Continue with Sonnet for implementation
ccc
```

**Workflow pattern**:

1. **Plan** (5 min):
   ```
   ❯ Help me plan implementing [feature]
   ❯ What edge cases should I consider?
   ```

2. **Implement** (60-90 min):
   ```
   ❯ Implement the login form with validation
   ❯ Add error handling for network failures
   ❯ Write tests for this new function
   ```

3. **Verify** (10 min):
   ```
   ❯ Review this code for potential bugs
   ❯ Are there any security issues?
   ```

4. **Document** (5 min):
   ```
   ❯ Generate JSDoc comments for this file
   ❯ Update README with new feature
   ```

---

## 🌆 Late Afternoon (Code Review)

### Switch to Opus for Quality

**Goal**: Ensure code quality before commit/PR

```bash
# Code review: Use Opus (best quality)
ccc-opus
```

**Pre-commit checklist**:
```
❯ Review all changes I made today for security issues
❯ Check for performance problems in this code
❯ Are there any edge cases I missed?
❯ Suggest improvements for code readability
❯ Check test coverage completeness
```

**Why Opus?**
- 🔍 Most thorough analysis
- 🛡️ Best security detection
- ✅ Catches subtle issues
- 💰 Free (Copilot)

**Time investment**: 10-15 minutes
**Value**: Catches bugs before review

---

## 🌙 End of Day (Cleanup & Documentation)

### Document Your Work

```bash
# Quick tasks: Use Haiku
ccc-haiku
```

**Closing tasks**:
```
❯ Generate a commit message for my changes
❯ Write PR description summarizing today's work
❯ Update CHANGELOG with today's changes
❯ Create a summary of what I accomplished today
```

**Final check**:
```bash
# Check status of all providers (for tomorrow)
ccs

# View today's session logs
grep "$(date '+%Y-%m-%d')" ~/.claude/claude-switch.log
```

## 💡 Pro Tips

### 1. Keep Sessions Open

Don't exit Claude Code between tasks:
```bash
# Start in morning
ccc

# Use all day
❯ [task 1]
❯ [task 2]
❯ [task 3]

# Exit at end of day
/exit
```

### 2. Use Multiple Terminals

Run different models in parallel:
```bash
# Terminal 1: Main work
ccc

# Terminal 2: Quick questions
ccc-haiku

# Terminal 3: Background analysis
ccc-opus
```

### 3. Private Code Separate

Keep proprietary code in separate session:
```bash
# Terminal 1: Public/internal code
ccc

# Terminal 2: Confidential code
cco  # Ollama (100% local)
```

### 4. Cost Tracking

All Copilot commands are free, but track Anthropic usage:
```bash
# Count Anthropic sessions (paid)
grep "mode=direct" ~/.claude/claude-switch.log | wc -l

# Count Copilot sessions (free)
grep "mode=copilot" ~/.claude/claude-switch.log | wc -l
```

## 🚫 Common Mistakes to Avoid

### ❌ Don't: Use Opus for Everything
```bash
# Wasteful - slow for simple tasks
ccc-opus
❯ What is 2+2?
```

### ✅ Do: Match Model to Task
```bash
# Efficient - fast model for simple task
ccc-haiku
❯ What is 2+2?
```

---

### ❌ Don't: Exit Between Small Tasks
```bash
ccc
❯ Task 1
/exit

ccc  # Restart for task 2 (loses context)
❯ Task 2
```

### ✅ Do: Keep Session Open
```bash
ccc
❯ Task 1
❯ Task 2  # Maintains context
❯ Task 3
```

---

### ❌ Don't: Use Ollama for Large Projects
```bash
# Will be very slow (2-6 min responses)
cco  # Large project with 60K context
```

### ✅ Do: Use Cloud for Large Projects
```bash
# Fast (1-3s responses)
ccc  # Large project
```

---

## 📈 Measuring Your Efficiency

### Track Your Patterns

```bash
# Session durations
grep "Session ended" ~/.claude/claude-switch.log | \
  awk '{print $7}' | \
  sort | uniq -c

# Most used provider
grep "Session started" ~/.claude/claude-switch.log | \
  grep "$(date '+%Y-%m-%d')" | \
  awk '{print $5}' | \
  sort | uniq -c
```

### Optimize Based on Data

- **>50% Opus usage?** → Try using Sonnet more (faster)
- **>30% Haiku usage?** → Good efficiency!
- **Using Ollama on large project?** → Switch to Copilot

---

## 🎓 Weekly Optimization

### Friday Afternoon Review

```bash
# Review week's usage
tail -100 ~/.claude/claude-switch.log

# Questions to ask:
# - Am I using the right models?
# - Any patterns to optimize?
# - Should I adjust workflow?
```

### Adjust Next Week

Based on findings:
- Slow tasks → Try faster model
- Quality issues → Upgrade model
- Cost concerns → More Copilot, less Anthropic
